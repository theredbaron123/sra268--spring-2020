There is expected to be a large amount of precipitation as April is an early spring month and is largely characterized by large amounts of rain.   "

        "Ultimately, the data presented for April shows that while it did rain the majority of days throughout April 2018, it was not a relatively consistently high volume of rain. The data instead shows that there was an average of .19 inches of rainfall throughout the month of April. The shortest span of time without any rainfall in April 2018 was a four day span from the 21st to the 24th. "
